# Introduction

This document  includes tutorials for running an entire OpenROAD-based flow from RTL to GDSII.This tutorials  includes  GUI visualisation , EDA tools,Design Explorations, and  Different Design Experiments. Additionally, a brief description of each step in the flow is provided, facilitating the user's comprehension and ease of usage.


# Overview Of OpenLane Flow

# PDK Support

The major component of physical design is PDK (Process Design Kit). The OpenROAD application is PDK independent. However it is tested and validated with specific PDKs in the context of various flow controllers.

The OpenROAD supports both public and private PDKs including:

## Open Source PDK
- Skywater 130 nm
- Nangate45 
- ASAP7 - Predictive FinFET 7nm

## Proprietary PDKs

These PDKS are supported in OpenROAD-flow-scripts only. They are used to test and calibrate OpenROAD against commercial platforms and ensure good QoR. The PDKs and platform-specific files for these kits cannot be provided due to NDA restrictions. However, if you are able to access these platforms independently, you can create the necessary platform-specific files yourself.
- GF55 - 55nm
- GF12 - 12nm
- GF180 - 180nm
- Intel22 - 22nm
- Intel16 - 16nm
- TSMC65 - 65nm

## OpenLane with Google-SKY130-PDK

The SkyWater Open Source PDK is a collaboration between Google and SkyWater Technology Foundry to provide a fully open source Process Design Kit and related resources, which can be used to create manufacturable designs at SkyWaterâ€™s facility.

The SkyWater Open Source PDK documentation can be found at [SkyWater](https://skywater-pdk.rtfd.io)

## Open Source Tools:
The OpenRoad Openlane is a automated RTL to GDSII flow build around open source tool. The flow perform the auto place and route of an ASIC design -in 24 hours with no human in the loop.  Tool used in OpenLane are listed below:

1. **Synthesis**
   - ` yosys` - Performs RTL synthesis
   - `abc` - Performs technology mapping
   - `OpenSTA` - Performs static timing analysis on the resulting netlist to generate timing reports
   
2. **Floor planning**
   - `init_fp` - Defines the core area for the macro as well as the rows (used for placement) and the tracks (used for routing)
